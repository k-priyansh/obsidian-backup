# TargetName

## Objective
[Brief Objective - Remove this afterwards]

The Detection Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Example

| Title:               | Cisco ASA Software IKEv1 and IKEv2 Buffer Overflow Vulnerability(CVE-2016-1287)                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CVSS 3.1 Score:      | 9.8 (Critical)                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Attack Vector:       | Network - The Cisco ASA device was exposed to the internet since it was used to facilitate connections to the internal network through VPN.                                               |
| Attack Complexity:   | Low - All the attacker has to do is execute the available exploit against the device                                                                                                      |
| Privileges Required: | None - The attack could be executed from an unauthenticated/unauthorized perspective                                                                                                      |
| User Interaction:    | None - No user interaction is required                                                                                                                                                    |
| Scope:               | Unchanged - Although you can use the exploited device as a pivot, you cannot affect other components by exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability.                                     |
| Confidentiality:     | High - Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unrestricted access in the form of a reverse shell. Attackers have total control over what information is obtained.        |
| Integrity:           | High - Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unrestricted access in the form of a reverse shell. Attackers can modify all or critical data on the vulnerable component. |
| Availability:        | High - Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in unrestricted access in the form of a reverse shell. Attackers can deny the service to users by powering the device off     |



### Tools Used
